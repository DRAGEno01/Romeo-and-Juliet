# Romeo and Juliet - How to Download

GitHub is easy to use when it comes to downloading the code. But before you start, you need to read all the steps.

- On the right, there is something called: 'Releases'
Clicking on releases will take you to a page where you can select a tag to use and download.

- Click the Latest Version you see.
You will then see 3 download options below.

- Click the icon with the BOX to download the correct files.
There you go, you have downloaded a ZIP file with the site in it.

Becareful to download the latest version and not the ALPHA, we are currently in BETA and would request you download the latest version: BETA.

# To view the Releases you will need to go back to the home page!
