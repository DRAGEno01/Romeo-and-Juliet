# Romeo and Juliet - Read Me

Welcome to the home of the Romeo and Juliet site. This site was made for 9.19, a year 9 class in Melbourne on year 2022. The page was only ment for one or two pages of information, but has become much more.


So where are we going from here?
DRAGE Co. is developing new things for you to be able to use, while MMancev Industries are working with DRAGE Co. for a two-year-relationship. This means that both partys are willing to continue to make a new website, with a different idea. You will be able to find the new site link on this page around next year.

# What is the Romeo and Juliet Site?

The site contains information, video, essay helper and quizes helping people with learning about Romeo and Juliet. The site is a downloadable zip folder that is run on your computer.
